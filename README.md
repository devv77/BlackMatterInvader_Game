# BlackMatter Invaders #

This game was created for a university task and a community challenge in our university. 
Unhappilly this was not the one that was chosen into the challenge, but it was given a good rating.
This game based on the '70s Space Invaders, but with somewhat updated graphics and simple game mechanic.
The game was written in a WPF application. 

This project was created in 2021
